Hello this is a Readme file of Git commands and how to use it:
There are 4 stages in Git
1. Working directory
2. Staging directory
3. Local repository
4. Remote repository

1. Working directory:
 It is the state where code is not saved or commited and still Working on it(When we get the status of the this by 'git status'
 in the terminal or cmd it will show untracked files.)

2. Staging Directory:
 It is the state where all the saved files will be present and now we can commit these files to 
 Local repository.
 this staging directory plays an imp role , i,e with the help of this we can send a required filr to 
 local repository, we cannot send a single file from working directory to local repository.
